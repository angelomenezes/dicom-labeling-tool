# Web-based DICOM viewer with labeling tool

This repository contains a simple web-based DICOM viewer built using Streamlit. The viewer also has a tool to annotate which slices of a specific series of dicom files have anomalies. Annotations are in .JSON format with labels "Anomaly" and "Slices" for each series. This tool was meant to be a weekend project for me to learn how to work with Streamlit, Docker and Heroku, but it took a little more than that to figure out how to set up everything and to make it look good.

[Demo hosted on Heroku](https://dicom-labeling-tool.herokuapp.com/)

The tool only deals with zip files that have one or more folders, normally represented as `series`, with dicom files inside. A [sample](sample/sample.zip) of an acceptable zip file can be checked inside the sample folder.
Zip files can be uploaded via public shared URLs from *Google Drive* or using the file upload widget. 

As the demo is hosted on Heroku and their free tier dyno has limited memory resources, uploaded zip files are limited to 100MB. However, this restriction can be adjusted by code when running the web viewer locally.


# Setup
## Docker

Clone the repository and set the current directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/angelomenezes/dicom-labeling-tool.git
cd dicom-labeling-tool/
``` 

For running a local docker container, change the line in the Docker file from:
```docker
CMD streamlit run DICOM.py --server.port $PORT
```
to
```docker
CMD streamlit run DICOM.py --server.port 8501
```

Then, you can build and run successfully the container with:

```bash
docker build ./ --tag webapp:v1
docker container run -p 8501:8501 webapp:v1
```

To finish, open the browser at http://localhost:8501/

## Conda
Make sure you have [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) installed since it is the easiest way to setup GDCM on Python3 which is a requirement for the pydicom library.

**(Optional)** Create a conda environment for installing and running the app:

```bash
conda create --name DICOM_env python=3.6.10 -y
conda activate DICOM_env
```

Clone the repository and set the current directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/angelomenezes/dicom-labeling-tool.git
cd dicom-labeling-tool/webapp/

conda install -c conda-forge -y gdcm
pip install -r requirements.txt

streamlit run DICOM.py
```
To finish, open the browser at http://localhost:8501/
